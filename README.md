# BillGuarded

BillGuarded is a self-service 3PL invoice reconciliation product for ecommerce operators. It compares structured fulfillment invoices against customer-supplied commercial terms and produces evidence-linked potential discrepancies for review.

## Production offer

- Full 90-Day Audit — **$1,500 one time**
- Continuous Monitor — **controlled early access; paid subscriptions are disabled until recurring ingestion is production-ready**

The current deterministic engine accepts one CSV contract/rate card plus up to 10 CSV invoices. Checkout fails closed before payment if the supported structured files are not present. The combined upload is capped at 50 MB, with a 20 MB per-file limit.

## Current deterministic checks

- Duplicate charges, including duplicates repeated across separate invoice CSVs
- Unsupported service/fee codes
- Line arithmetic mismatches
- Billed unit-rate mismatches against the supplied rate card
- Conservative potential-recovery aggregation that avoids double counting multiple findings on the same source row

Findings require operational review and do not guarantee refunds, credits, or recoveries.
Completed paid audits also produce a deterministic Recovery Review Draft with
source-row citations and an explicit human-approval checklist. BillGuarded does
not send or submit that draft automatically.

The portfolio-level evidence-to-outcome architecture is documented in
[`docs/RECOVERY-TWIN.md`](docs/RECOVERY-TWIN.md).

## Production binding

- Canonical site: `https://billguarded.com`
- GitHub: `ehudso7/billguarded`
- Vercel project: `everton-hudsons-projects/billguarded`
- Vercel project ID: `prj_uFLTZhEoI8rkgGtYPKn3K5wRrzuI`
- Supabase project: `rduryyyprvwqzopsvzvr`
- Stripe live account: `acct_1U6prLB5mhEA8v5j`
- Stripe sandbox account: `acct_1U6prVBOw52KUyWD`

Some legacy infrastructure identifiers still contain `reqovr` because BillGuarded was renamed after the initial infrastructure was created. They are compatibility identifiers only and are not customer-facing branding. The runtime webhook-secret RPC is named `billguarded_stripe_webhook_secret()` while reading the existing Vault secret without exposing or rotating it unnecessarily.

## Local setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Add a server-only Stripe sandbox key locally. Never commit it.
3. Ensure the BillGuarded Supabase variables are available locally.
4. Apply the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in version order.
5. Store the Stripe webhook signing secret in Supabase Vault under the existing compatibility secret name used by production; never commit or log it.
6. Configure the Stripe webhook endpoint as `https://billguarded.com/api/stripe/webhook` and subscribe it to the required Checkout, subscription, and invoice events documented in the webhook handler.
7. Configure server-only `CRON_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` values. Register `https://billguarded.com/api/resend/webhook` only for the transactional lifecycle events in the durable fulfillment runbook.
8. Run `npm ci`, then `npm run check` before deployment.

## Security model

### Intake and uploads

- Intake creation is database-rate-limited by a one-way network fingerprint.
- Each new audit workspace receives a random 256-bit access token.
- Only the SHA-256 hash of the workspace token is stored in Postgres.
- Upload reservation, upload confirmation, and Checkout creation require the matching token.
- Uploads use short-lived signed URLs into the private `audit-documents` bucket.
- File count and storage-size limits are enforced server-side and in Postgres.
- Production intake accepts CSV files only so the UI and engine have the same capability boundary.
- Customers must accept the Terms and Privacy Notice and confirm they are authorized to upload the business records.

### Billing

- Production payment state is synchronized from signature-verified Stripe webhook events.
- Webhook event IDs are stored for idempotency.
- Production Checkout and post-payment redirects are pinned to `https://billguarded.com`.
- Continuous Monitor Checkout is rejected until the recurring product is production-ready.
- Only the Full 90-Day Audit product and its canonical $1,500 Price remain active in the live Stripe catalog.

### Customer report access and recovery

- A successful Checkout issues an HMAC-signed, HttpOnly access cookie scoped to BillGuarded.
- The completed audit page and downloadable findings CSV require that cookie and verify the audit belongs to the same Stripe customer.
- Customers who change devices or lose the cookie can use a private `https://billguarded.com/recover#session_id=...` bearer link generated from their exact paid Stripe Checkout Session.
- The browser fragment is not sent in the HTTP request. The recovery client immediately removes the fragment from the visible address and POSTs the credential to `/api/recover` in the request body.
- The recovery API re-verifies the Checkout with Stripe, requires a completed paid 90-Day Audit, and matches the request ID, Checkout Session ID, and Stripe customer ID before issuing a fresh access cookie.
- Recovery responses are `no-store`, use a `no-referrer` policy, and the recovery page is noindex/nofollow and excluded by robots. Recovery credentials must never be put in query strings, published, forwarded, or captured by analytics.
- Customer-delivery state is tracked separately from audit completion so a failed notification can be retried without reprocessing or recharging the audit.

### Data access

- Audit, finding, billing, and Stripe-event tables have RLS enabled.
- `anon` and `authenticated` do not have direct table privileges in the server-only model.
- Customer documents remain in a non-public Storage bucket.

## Reliability and CI

CI runs on pull requests and pushes to `main` and includes:

- locked dependency install
- production dependency vulnerability audit
- TypeScript typecheck
- ESLint
- Node 22 unit tests for CSV parsing, conservative recovery math, retry scheduling, and stale-worker recovery
- production Next.js build

Paid audit execution is claimed from Postgres by an independently scheduled, bearer-protected Vercel worker. Payment evidence, processing attempts, leases, retries, stale recovery, terminal failures, customer-delivery claims, provider acceptance, and Resend lifecycle events remain durable across serverless invocations. Partial findings from an interrupted or failed attempt are removed before a fresh attempt begins. An uncertain provider outcome is quarantined for operator reconciliation and is never blindly resent.

The privacy-safe acquisition and conversion contract is documented in [`docs/CONVERSION-MEASUREMENT.md`](docs/CONVERSION-MEASUREMENT.md). It uses the existing Supabase project as a server-only first-party ledger, stores only allowlisted attribution, and never treats a browser redirect as payment evidence.

The `/api/health` endpoint verifies that the production application can reach the database, reports the deployed Vercel Git commit for release certification, and returns `503` when the database dependency is unavailable.

The `Production Smoke` workflow runs after each `main` deployment and daily. For release runs it waits until the health endpoint reports the exact `GITHUB_SHA` being certified, then verifies:

- application and database health
- public pages, legal pages, private recovery page, robots, and sitemap
- security headers
- fail-closed behavior for unsigned Stripe/Resend webhooks, an unauthenticated fulfillment worker, and malformed intake, Checkout, and recovery requests
- noindex/nofollow behavior on the recovery surface
